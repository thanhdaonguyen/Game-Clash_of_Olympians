## Game rules

Try to protect your temple by throw your weapon to the enemy. You will aim your shot by holding the mousebutton and release it to fire. If your weapons hit the enemy, they will die and disappear. If you let the enemies close to your temple, they will do damage to your temple and you will see the HP decrease. If you let HP down to 0, you lose!
